Steps:

1. Install 'PageRip' chrome extension(https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pagerip-html-+-css-extrac/bkahkocegdkgicmmfpkoeipjmjaeohfn)

2. Choose 'Select Element' and grab the element you want to copy

3. Copy the HTML + CSS code and drop it in v0

4. Iterate by giving it more granular details

5. Move the code to Cursor

6. Open the composer window and ask it to place the code on your website

7. Fix the font size and spacing as per the rest of your website

Tips to get better results:

1. Use o1 preview with Cursor

2. Don't select multiple elements at once, the context window runs out on v0 if you have more than ~200 lines of code

3. See the code you have captured in the PageRip preview window to make sure you have the right element
