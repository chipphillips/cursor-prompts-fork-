## Steps:

1. Install 'PageRip' chrome extension([link](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pagerip-html-+-css-extrac/bkahkocegdkgicmmfpkoeipjmjaeohfn))
2. Choose 'Select Element' and grab the element you want to copy
3. Copy the HTML + CSS code and drop it in [v0](https://v0.dev)
4. Iterate by giving it more granular details
5. Move the code to Cursor
6. Open the composer window and ask it to place the code on your website
7. Fix the font size and spacing as per the rest of your website

## Tips to get better results:

1. Use [o1 preview](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/) with [Cursor](https://cursor.com)
2. Don't select multiple elements at once, the context window runs out on [v0](https://v0.dev) if you have more than ~200 lines of code
3. See the code you have captured in the PageRip preview window to make sure you have the right element
