## Cursor Composer Shortcuts
Cursor Composer allows you to modify multiple files at once or generate entire applications. To open it, use the following keyboard shortcuts:

Open Cursor Composer in a floating window: `CMD + I` (MacOS) or `CTRL + I` (Windows)
Open Cursor Composer in full-screen mode: `CMD + SHIFT + I` (MacOS) or `CTRL + SHIFT + I` (Windows)

Inside Composer, you can mention files by typing `@filename` or add files to the Composer by typing `#filename` (use `CMD + P/CTRL + P` to select multiple files at once).

## AI Pane Shortcuts
The AI Chat Pane is another way to interact with Cursor, where you can ask questions about your codebase and get suggestions. 
To open AI Chat Pane, use `CMD + L` (MacOS) or `CTRL + L` (Windows).

## Inline Editing Shortcut
With Cursor, you can also ask AI to edit your codebase directly. To do this, highlight some code and press CMD + K (MacOS) or CTRL + K (Windows).

You can close this inline editing mode by pressing ESC.



## Cursor Settings Shortcut
You can open the Cursor Settings by pressing `CMD + SHIFT + J` (MacOS) or `CTRL + SHIFT + J` (Windows).
